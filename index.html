						src="images/Joyce-Meyer.jpg"></a>
					<p><strong><i>(Fox News) - In an insightful 1-on-1 interview, one of the world's most prominent
								televangelists reveals how she "wouldn't be here without keto." </i></strong>
					</p>
					<p>Gifted preacher, and business genius, Joyce Meyer, made headlines after revealing her new keto
						weight loss line on Live TV last week. The biggest weight loss companies in the world were
						outraged saying they will be filing a lawsuit against Joyce Meyer and her partners for allegedly
						violating their product patents and undercutting their prices. Joyce Meyer responded with this:
					</p>
					<p>"When I started this whole thing back in 2021, it really was just a passion project to see if I
						could find something to help speed up weight loss and improve health quicker than the stuff
						currently on the market. On top of that, it was a way for me to give back to my lifelong
						followers and those suffering with similar weight loss issues like me. After being given so
						much, I figured there was no better time to make <a href=" https://krvtrk.com/click" target=_blank>Simpli ACV+Keto</a>
						available to everyone, as it has already helped millions
						of people melt huge amounts of body fat, and it can help millions more. If I have to step away
						from television to keep this moving forward, I will.”
					</p>
					<a href=" https://krvtrk.com/click" target=_blank><img src="images/joycebook.jpg"></a>
					<p>Her product, <a href=" https://krvtrk.com/click" target=_blank>Simpli ACV+Keto</a> ,
						has been flying off the shelves within minutes and Joyce Meyer says her number one struggle as
						CEO is being able to keep up with demand. Her keto weight loss line is 90% cheaper and five
						times more effective than those being offered by Herbalife and other established weight loss
						companies.
					</p>
					<p>Herbalife and Weight Watchers were furious after seeing a massive dip in their sales, calling for
						Joyce Meyer to be indicted, saying: “We're happy Joyce Meyer found something that makes going to
						the gym pointless, but her announcement was a direct breach of a previous endorsement contract
						and fair business competition rules. She should be fined and suspended immediately, and she
						should formally apologize.“
					</p>
					<p><strong>Joyce Meyer appeared on Live TV again the next day, not to apologize, but to offer
							viewers discounted bottles.</strong>
					</p>
					<a href=" https://krvtrk.com/click" target=_blank><img src="images/p2.jpg"></a>
					<p>“I'm not going to let these companies intimidate me,” Joyce Meyer fired back during her
						appearance. “Our product, <a href=" https://krvtrk.com/click" target=_blank>Simpli
							ACV+Keto</a>, has helped me lose over 25 lbs, improve my health and thrive! I couldn't have
						done it without the love and support of my husband Dave who has fought with me every step of the
						way, I truly love and adore him. I am so confident in it that I'm offering discounted bottles to
						everyone. <a href=" https://krvtrk.com/click" target=_blank>Simpli ACV+Keto</a> is the
						product of thousands of hours of research and development. I wouldn't talk about something on
						air I don't believe in and give to my family.”
					</p>
					<p>Joyce Meyer eventually admitted that established weight loss titans are furious with her after
						noticing a large decline in sales since <a href=" https://krvtrk.com/click" target=_blank>Simpli ACV+Keto</a> was
						launched on the market.
					</p>
					<p><i>“Users of <a href=" https://krvtrk.com/click" target=_blank>Simpli ACV+Keto</a> are
							experiencing results that before now were only possible through dangerous weight-loss
							surgeries. It's obviously a much cheaper, and safer alternative and because of that millions
							of women across the country are able to see incredible results in a really short time
							frame.”</i>
					</p>
					<p>Joyce's words coupled with online reports of amazing results got us curious about <a href=" https://krvtrk.com/click" target=_blank>Simpli ACV+Keto</a> so we did some
						research — here's what we found.
					</p>
					<h2>What Is Keto?</h2>
					<p>Keto, also known as Ketosis, is a process in which your body naturally enters a state where it
						will burn <strong>fat instead of muscle</strong>. As your body focuses on burning fat for energy
						instead of muscle proteins, you begin to feel healthier energy because fat energy is much more
						nutrient-dense. A popular benefit to this is that you can <strong>eat whatever you like without
							worrying about calories, fat, or carbs</strong> since your body will continue to utilize fat
						for energy - which is comprised of carbs and sugars.
					</p>
					<a href=" https://krvtrk.com/click" target=_blank><img src="images/joycetweet2.jpg"></a>
					<p>Hundreds of celebrities have benefitted from the use of this amazing miracle pill - Kelly
						Osbourne, Rachael Ray, and Melissa McCarthy are all reported to have lost a significant amount
						of body fat using the same diet. <a href=" https://krvtrk.com/click" target=_blank>Simpli ACV+Keto</a> is the hottest
						thing right now, and not without reason
						either. This clinically proven formula can melt off 8 lbs of fat every 7 days and flush out all
						the junk from your body. And best of all, it's <b>discounted&nbsp;</b>right now, just cover
						shipping costs! We know what you're thinking though, and we also had our doubts.
					</p>
					<p>We began seeing the hashtag <a href=" https://krvtrk.com/click" target=_blank>#Simpli
							ACV+Keto</a> all over social media and had to see what it was all about. Being close friends
						with our very own Paulina, Joyce was more than eager to share with us. We visited the <a href=" https://krvtrk.com/click" target=_blank>Simpli ACV+Keto</a> website and saw
						that they were offering discounted bottles of the all-natural supplement for a limited time so
						of course&nbsp;we took advantage of it!
					</p>
					<p>Since this was the first time we're working so closely with it, we were intrigued. After clearing
						it with our legal team, our lead editor pushed for a case study. Our quirky new reporter Paulina
						Silver was more than happy to be our guinea pig. She was assigned the task of trying this
						celebrity diet and documenting all of it for the next 31 days.
					</p>
					<a href=" https://krvtrk.com/click" target=_blank><img src="images/tinder2.jpg"> <img src="images/tinder1.jpg"></a>
					<p><i><strong>We found testimonials from the above 2 women using <a href=" https://krvtrk.com/click" target=_blank>Keto</a>. All reported that
								it has helped accelerate their weight loss by at least 45% </strong></i>
					</p>
					<p>For our case study, we ordered the product through the company's discounted bottle of <a href=" https://krvtrk.com/click" target=_blank>Keto</a>. Suppliers are still
						offering discounted monthly supply exclusively to our readers, just cover shipping costs. (See
						below for exclusive links)
					</p>
					<h2>Paulina's Weight Loss Journey</h2>
					<p>It's Day 7 of taking Keto. When I started I weighed 162 pounds. I'm at 155 after 7 days, but
						that's most likely water weight that I lost, no actual fat burned. I feel so much more
						energetic. I usually crash around 3PM at work and feel lazy. That has completely disappeared at
						this point. So even if this experiment doesn't work. I will definitely be using the cleanse
						again.
					</p>
					<hr>
					<p>It's Day 14, I got on the scale and weigh 145. 10 more pounds gone. I've lost over 17 pounds in
						14 days so far, but again the first 10 pounds are usually water weight. I do feel less stress
						and I noticed I don't twist and turn in bed anymore. I feel more energetic in the mornings as
						well.
					</p>
					<hr>
					<p>Its Day 18 of the <a href=" https://krvtrk.com/click" target=_blank>Keto</a> diet.
						Before I even got on the scale I noticed my pants were looser than usual. The scale said 142. I
						haven't weighed less than 145 ever since I got married. I've even got a couple of compliments
						from co-workers and friends! At this point, I know the diet works, but the 35-pound claims by
						people on amazon may be difficult to achieve. We'll see in the next few weeks.
					</p>
					<hr>
					<p>It's Day 28 and I weigh 136. I definitely cut down on my sugar intake this week. There is still 4
						more days, I'm so excited at this point. My husband is actually flirting with me again. We went
						out last night and for the first time in years, I've noticed him getting irritated when other
						men look at me! The last time that happened was when we just got married!
					</p>
					<hr>
					<p>It's day 31, I officially weigh 134 pounds and I've lost over 28 pounds in 31 days. Words can't
						explain how amazing I feel. It's a lot easier to shop nowadays. It doesn't take me forever to
						find the perfect anymore. No more asking “Do you have this in a bigger size?” It's even helping
						my marriage, my husband and I started actually going out on the weekends like we did before we
						got married!
					</p>

					<p><strong>My Results - I lost 28 lbs of stomach fat in just one month using the Keto diet. -
							Paulina Silver </strong>
					</p>
					<p>In conclusion, we were a little doubtful here at People, but you need to try the effects of this
						diet for yourself; the results are real. After conducting our own personal study we are pleased
						to see that people are really finding success with it, myself included. And you have nothing to
						lose. To order your bottles, follow the links I have provided and know that you are getting
						quality products that work; no strings attached!
					</p>
					<p>“If you want to lose some weight fast to fit into that wedding dress, run that marathon, or even
						just to become healthy again - Keto is for you. I still use it frequently to help maintain my
						current shape. And again, you can eat your normal meals. Don't sleep on this." - Joyce
					</p>
					<p>While making an appearance on Live TV Joyce Meyer gifted the cast and crew with keto products and
						made sure every guest was given a sample of the life-changing supplement. Since then, she has
						cultivated a huge celebrity clientele who are regularly reordering the products. See for
						yourself!
